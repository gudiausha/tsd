A general **hierarchy of time complexities**, ranked from most efficient to least efficient, along with brief notes about each one:

### **Time Complexity Hierarchy**:

1. **O(1) - Constant Time**:
   - **Best**: Constant time complexity is the most favorable.
   - The operation's runtime is independent of the input size.
   - Example: Accessing an element in an array, simple arithmetic operations.

2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**:
   - **Very Good**: Logarithmic time is also highly efficient.
   - Usually happens when the problem size reduces by a factor (like binary search).
   - Example: Binary search in a sorted array, searching in balanced binary trees.

3. **O(n) - Linear Time**:
   - **Good**: Linear time is still manageable, especially for large datasets.
   - The operation’s time grows proportionally with the input size.
   - Example: Traversing an array or list, finding the max/min in an array.

4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time**:
   - **Acceptable**: This is the time complexity of efficient algorithms like merge sort, quicksort (average case), and heap sort.
   - Example: Merge sort, heapsort, and many divide-and-conquer algorithms.

5. **O(n²) - Quadratic Time**:
   - **Less Efficient**: This time complexity is feasible for small input sizes but becomes inefficient as the input grows larger.
   - Example: Simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort (in worst case).

6. **O(n³) - Cubic Time**:
   - **Poor**: This time complexity is inefficient and usually only tolerable for small input sizes.
   - Example: Some dynamic programming algorithms, such as Floyd-Warshall for shortest paths.

7. **O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time**:
   - **Very Poor**: This is very inefficient, and the time grows exponentially as input size increases.
   - Example: Recursive algorithms that solve subproblems multiple times, like the naive solution for the traveling salesman problem, recursive Fibonacci.

8. **O(n!) - Factorial Time**:
   - **Worst**: Factorial time complexity is the least efficient and only tolerable for extremely small input sizes.
   - Example: Algorithms that generate all possible permutations of a list, such as the brute force solution for the traveling salesman problem.

### **Summary**:
- **Favorable**: O(1), O(log n), O(n)
- **Manageable**: O(n log n)
- **Less Favorable**: O(n²)
- **Avoid**: O(n³), O(2ⁿ), O(n!)

### Common Time Complexities in Problems:
- **O(1)**: Hash table lookups, simple arithmetic operations.
- **O(log n)**: Binary search, tree operations like insertion/search in balanced trees.
- **O(n)**: Iteration through lists, arrays, and queues.
- **O(n log n)**: Sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort (average case).
- **O(n²)**: Nested loops, brute force comparisons.
