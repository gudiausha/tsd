    "In the given program, if you **don't use the `global` keyword** for the `counter` variable, you will get an error or unexpected behavior because of how **variable scope** works in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does the `global` keyword cause an error without it?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Scope**:\n",
    "   - By default, when you modify a variable inside a function, Python assumes the variable is **local to that function**.\n",
    "   - When you assign a value to a variable inside a function, Python treats it as a **local variable**. If the variable is not defined within the function, Python will try to look for it in the local scope. This can lead to errors when trying to modify a **global variable** from within a function without declaring it as `global`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What happens when `global` is not used**:\n",
    "   - In your case, `counter` is a **global variable**, and both threads are trying to modify it. When you try to modify `counter` inside the thread functions (`thread1` and `thread2`), Python assumes you're trying to create a **local variable** called `counter` inside each function.\n",
    "   - Python then can't find a reference to the global `counter` in the function's local scope, causing an **error** or **unexpected behavior** because it's trying to create a new local variable without any clear initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: What happens without `global`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'counter' referenced before assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the `global` keyword fix the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you declare the variable as `global` inside the function, Python knows you want to refer to the global `counter` variable instead of creating a new local variable with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you use the `global` keyword, Python knows that you want to access and modify the global variable `counter`, and no error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- Without the `global` keyword, Python treats the `counter` variable as **local** to each thread function.\n",
    "- Since `counter` is not defined locally within the function, Python throws an **UnboundLocalError**.\n",
    "- Using the `global` keyword tells Python that you're referring to the **global variable**, not creating a new local one, and allows both threads to modify the same `counter` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By marking `counter` as `global`, you ensure that the changes made in **both threads** are reflected on the same **global counter** and not on separate local copies of the variable."

    "No, simply declaring `global counter = 0` inside the function doesn't work. The `global` keyword is used to **refer to a global variable** inside a function, but **it cannot be used to define or initialize a variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does `global counter = 0` not work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `global` keyword is only used to **access** and **modify** an existing global variable inside a function. It does **not** allow you to declare or initialize the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose of `global` keyword**:\n",
    "   - The `global` keyword is used to **refer to an already existing variable** in the global scope, not to initialize or assign a value to it.\n",
    "   - When you use `global counter`, you are telling Python that you intend to modify or use the global `counter` variable, which already exists in the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Declaring a new global variable**:\n",
    "   - A variable must be initialized **once** in the global scope (outside of any functions) before you use it. You cannot **declare** a variable with `global` inside a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens if You Try `global counter = 0`?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def thread1():\n",
    "    global counter = 0  # This will give an error\n",
    "    counter += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SyntaxError: can't use assignment in 'global' statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `global` keyword is used **without an assignment**, just to indicate that the variable is global. It doesn't allow you to assign a value to a global variable directly in the global scope inside a function.\n",
    "- To initialize a global variable, you need to assign a value to it **before** using it in any functions. You can **initialize** it in the global scope, and then use `global` in functions when you want to **modify** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can **initialize** the global variable outside any function (e.g., `counter = 0`).\n",
    "- You use the `global` keyword **inside the function** to modify the global variable.\n",
    "- The `global` keyword cannot be used to **assign a value** to a global variable inside the function.\n"
