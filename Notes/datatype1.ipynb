    "- Ordered: They contain elements or items that are sequentially arranged according to their specific insertion order.\n",
    "- Zero-based: They allow you to access their elements by indices that start from zero.\n",
    "- Mutable: They support in-place mutations or changes to their contained elements.\n",
    "- Heterogeneous: They can store objects of different types.\n",
    "- Growable and dynamic: They can grow or shrink dynamically, which means that they support the addition, insertion, and removal of elements.\n",
    "- Nestable: They can contain other lists, so you can have lists of lists.\n",
    "- Iterable: They support iteration, so you can traverse them using a loop or comprehension while you perform operations on each of their elements.\n",
    "- Sliceable: They support slicing operations, meaning that you can extract a series of elements from them.\n",
    "- Combinable: They support concatenation operations, so you can combine two or more lists using the concatenation operators.\n",
    "- Copyable: They allow you to make copies of their content using various techniques."

    "| **Memory Usage** | Less (No extra space for growth) | More (Allocates extra space) |\n",
    "| **Iteration** | Faster (Cache-friendly, optimized) | Slower (More memory overhead) |\n",
