In Python, the statement `if __name__ == "__main__":` is used to ensure that a specific block of code is executed **only when the script is run directly**, and **not** when it is imported as a module into another script. 

### What Does It Mean?

- **`__name__`**: This is a special built-in variable in Python that gets set when a Python file is executed. Its value depends on how the file is being executed:
  - If the file is being **run directly**, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`.
  - If the file is **imported as a module** into another file, `__name__` is set to the **module's name** (the filename of the module without the `.py` extension).

### Purpose

By checking `if __name__ == "__main__":`, you ensure that certain code (such as starting the main program logic or running tests) is **only executed when the file is run directly** and not when it’s imported into another module.

### Example:

```python
# my_script.py

def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    greet()
```

#### When run directly:

```bash
$ python my_script.py
```

Output:
```
Hello, world!
```

Explanation:
- Since `my_script.py` is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`, so the condition `if __name__ == "__main__":` evaluates to `True` and the `greet()` function is called.

#### When imported into another script:

```python
# another_script.py

import my_script
```

Output:
- **No output**, because when `my_script.py` is imported, `__name__` in `my_script.py` is not `"__main__"`—it’s set to `"my_script"`. Therefore, the code inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is not executed.

### Common Use Cases:
1. **Testing or debugging**: You can write test code in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that only runs when the script is executed directly, helping in debugging and unit testing.
2. **Main entry point**: In larger applications, it’s used to designate the entry point of the program, running only the necessary logic when executed directly.

### Summary:
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`** is used to control the execution of code in Python scripts, allowing you to run some code only when the file is run directly and preventing it from running when the file is imported as a module.
