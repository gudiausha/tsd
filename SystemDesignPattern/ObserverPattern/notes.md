In real-world applications with potentially millions of users subscribing to various notifications (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications), handling users individually as objects (like in your current implementation) works well at a small scale. However, as the system scales, this approach can become inefficient due to memory and performance constraints. In production environments, large-scale systems typically handle users differently.

Here’s how user subscriptions and notifications are managed in **real-time** apps for handling large-scale users:

### 1. **Database-Driven Subscriptions**
Instead of creating objects for each user in memory, user subscriptions are typically stored in a **database**. Here’s a simplified flow:

- **Database Tables**: Store user details, their preferences (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications), and subscription status.
    - **Users table**: Contains user information like `user_id`, `email`, `phone`, etc.
    - **Subscriptions table**: Contains a mapping between users and their subscription preferences (`user_id`, `subscription_type`, `is_active`).
  
  For example:
  ```plaintext
  Users table:
  | user_id | name      | email              | phone       |
  |---------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
  | 1       | Alice     | alice@example.com  | 1234567890  |
  | 2       | Bob       | bob@example.com    | 0987654321  |

  Subscriptions table:
  | user_id | subscription_type | is_active |
  |---------|-------------------|-----------|
  | 1       | email             | True      |
  | 2       | sms               | True      |
  ```

- **On Notification Trigger**: When an event occurs (e.g., a new message), the system queries the database to retrieve users who are subscribed to that specific notification type. Then, it processes notifications for these users in **batches** rather than individual objects in memory.

### 2. **Batch Processing and Queuing**
Handling notifications for millions of users all at once is inefficient. Instead, notifications are typically processed using **batch processing** techniques:
  
- **Message Queues (MQ)**: When an event occurs, a message (notification) is placed in a queue, such as **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, or **AWS SQS**. These systems handle large volumes of messages efficiently by processing them asynchronously.
  
- **Batch Jobs**: A batch job pulls users from the queue or database in chunks (e.g., 10,000 users at a time), prepares the notifications (email, SMS, push), and sends them to a **notification service** (e.g., Twilio for SMS, Amazon SES for email).
  
    Example flow:
    - Event triggers a message to be placed in the queue (e.g., "Send email notification").
    - A job queries the database to get 10,000 email subscribers.
    - The job processes this batch and sends notifications, then moves on to the next batch.

### 3. **Notification Services (External APIs)**
Instead of sending notifications directly from your application, companies rely on **external services** to handle sending notifications at scale:
  
- **Email Notifications**: Services like **Amazon SES**, **SendGrid**, or **Mailchimp** are used to send bulk emails.
- **SMS Notifications**: Providers like **Twilio**, **Nexmo**, or **Plivo** handle SMS delivery.
- **Push Notifications**: Services like **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** or **Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)** handle mobile and web push notifications.

These services are optimized for sending thousands or even millions of messages concurrently and offer features like delivery tracking and retries.

### 4. **Caching for Frequent Updates**
To optimize performance and reduce load on the database, **caching** can be used. **Redis** or **Memcached** can store frequently accessed subscription data temporarily in memory. This prevents hitting the database for every notification event.

### 5. **Microservices Architecture**
Large-scale apps often separate the notification system into its own **microservice**. The notification service has its own responsibility:
- It can interact with different channels (email, SMS, push).
- It manages sending batches of notifications.
- It scales independently, based on the load.

Each service (e.g., email, SMS) has its own logic and infrastructure, making it easier to manage, scale, and optimize.

### 6. **Event-Driven Architecture**
In an **event-driven architecture**, each change or action in the system (e.g., a user subscribing, new content published) triggers **events**. These events propagate through the system to notify interested components. For example:
- When a new article is published, an event is triggered.
- This event is picked up by the notification system, which queries users subscribed to relevant content and sends notifications.

### Example Notification Flow in a Real-Time System
Let’s break it down:
1. **User subscribes** to email/SMS notifications. The system saves their preference in the **database**.
2. **Event Occurs** (e.g., a sale on the platform).
3. The system **triggers an event** (e.g., "Notify subscribers about the sale").
4. The **Notification Service** retrieves batches of users from the database.
5. Users are added to a **message queue** to avoid overwhelming the system.
6. The queue **processes** and sends the notifications via external services like **SendGrid** or **Twilio**.

### Key Takeaways for Handling Large-Scale Users:
1. **Database-driven**: Use a database to store user subscriptions rather than creating in-memory objects.
2. **Batch processing**: Handle notifications in chunks instead of all at once.
3. **Asynchronous processing**: Use message queues and external services to send notifications at scale.
4. **External APIs**: Rely on scalable email/SMS providers for notification delivery.
5. **Scalability**: Build separate microservices for notification handling, scaling each service independently.

This approach allows handling **millions of users** with minimal impact on performance, scalability, and reliability.
