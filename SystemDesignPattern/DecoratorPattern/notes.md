### Key Differences Between Without Decorator Pattern and With Decorator Pattern:

1. **Hardcoding Behavior vs. Dynamic Composition**:
   - Without the decorator pattern, behaviors are hardcoded into classes like `ExtendedWrapee` or `AnotherExtendedWrapee`. To add new behavior, you must subclass or modify the existing classes.
   - In the decorator pattern, you can dynamically add new behavior by chaining decorators together. This allows behavior to be extended without altering the existing class or using inheritance.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Without the decorator, each time you need to extend behavior, you create new subclasses. This can lead to an explosion of subclasses if multiple combinations of behaviors are needed.
   - With the decorator, you can wrap objects with different decorators at runtime, allowing for more flexible and reusable behavior.

3. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - Without decorators, each class often needs to handle multiple behaviors, violating the **Single Responsibility Principle**.
   - With decorators, each decorator is responsible for a specific behavior, and you can compose them to create complex functionality.

4. **Inheritance Hierarchy**:
   - Without decorators, inheritance is used to extend functionality, leading to deeper and more complex inheritance hierarchies.
   - With decorators, the same object can be wrapped multiple times, and behavior can be dynamically added without requiring deep inheritance trees.

5. **Combining Behaviors**:
   - Without decorators, if you wanted to combine the behaviors of `ExtendedWrapee` and `AnotherExtendedWrapee`, you'd have to create yet another subclass that combines both behaviors.
   - With decorators, you can dynamically combine them by wrapping an object with both `Decorator1` and `Decorator2`, allowing for more flexible composition.

### Example Scenario:

- **Without Decorators**: To combine two behaviors (let’s say, logging and validation), you’d need to create a new subclass that combines both. Every time a new behavior is needed, you either modify the base class or create more subclasses.
  
- **With Decorators**: You can create individual decorators for logging, validation, caching, etc. Then, at runtime, you can wrap your object with any combination of these decorators as needed.

### Conclusion:
Without the decorator pattern, extending functionality requires direct subclassing or modification of existing classes, which limits flexibility and leads to more rigid code structures. The decorator pattern offers a more flexible, scalable way to extend an object's behavior without altering the underlying class or resorting to subclassing.

### Key Differences Between Decorators and Decorator Design Pattern:

In Python, **decorators** (functions that wrap other functions or methods) and the **Decorator Design Pattern** (an object-oriented design pattern) both aim to add functionality, but they operate differently and are used in different contexts. Below is a detailed explanation comparing them, followed by an example.

### 1. **Python Function Decorators**:

- **Purpose**: Python function decorators are syntactic sugar used to modify or extend the behavior of a function or method without modifying its source code. They take a function as input and return a new function that typically adds some behavior.
  
- **Scope**: Primarily used to wrap functions and methods, adding behavior like logging, access control, or validation.

- **Application**: Typically used for function-level modifications like authentication, caching, timing, etc.

### Example of Python Function Decorators:

```python
# Define a simple decorator function
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something before the function.")
        func()  # Call the original function
        print("Something after the function.")
    return wrapper

# Applying decorator using the @ syntax
@my_decorator
def wrapee():
    print("Hello, I am the original function!")

wrapee()
```

#### Output:

```
Something before the function.
Hello, I am the original function!
Something after the function.
```

Here, the decorator (`my_decorator`) adds behavior before and after the original function (`wrapee`). You can apply the decorator by using the `@` symbol, which is the syntactic sugar in Python.

### 2. **Decorator Design Pattern**:

- **Purpose**: The decorator design pattern is a structural pattern used to add behavior to objects at runtime. It relies on inheritance or composition to "decorate" objects with additional features while keeping the original object's interface intact.

- **Scope**: This pattern is used for object-level behavior extension. It's particularly useful when you want to add behavior dynamically and for multiple objects, avoiding subclassing and keeping the code flexible.

- **Application**: Typically used when you need to extend functionality in a flexible, runtime-composable way.

### Example of the Decorator Design Pattern:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Wrapee:
    def msg(self):
        print("Hello, I am the base object method - Wrapee.")

class BaseDecorator(ABC, Wrapee):
    def __init__(self, wrapee_obj):
        self.wrapee_obj = wrapee_obj
    
    def msg(self):
        self.wrapee_obj.msg()

# First concrete decorator
class Decorator1(BaseDecorator):
    def msg(self):
        print("Adding behavior in Decorator1")
        super().msg()

# Second concrete decorator
class Decorator2(BaseDecorator):
    def msg(self):
        print("Adding behavior in Decorator2")
        super().msg()

# Using the decorators to wrap the original object
if __name__ == '__main__':
    wrapee_obj = Wrapee()  # Base object
    
    # Wrapping with first decorator
    decorator1 = Decorator1(wrapee_obj)
    decorator1.msg()

    print()

    # Wrapping with second decorator
    decorator2 = Decorator2(decorator1)
    decorator2.msg()
```

#### Output:

```
Adding behavior in Decorator1
Hello, I am the base object method - Wrapee.

Adding behavior in Decorator2
Adding behavior in Decorator1
Hello, I am the base object method - Wrapee.
```

In this example, we create decorators (`Decorator1`, `Decorator2`) that wrap around the `Wrapee` object, adding functionality before calling the original `msg` method.

| **Runtime Behavior**        | Wraps functions, applies globally once decorated           | Wraps objects, can combine decorators at runtime |
| **Syntactic Sugar**         | Uses `@decorator` syntax                                   | Uses explicit class composition                  |

### Summary:

- **Python Function Decorators**: Are simpler, used to modify the behavior of functions or methods directly. They provide syntactic sugar (`@decorator`) and are great for cases like logging, timing, or access control for functions.
  
- **Decorator Design Pattern**: Is a structural pattern for dynamically adding behavior to objects at runtime. It’s more flexible and powerful, especially when dealing with object-oriented design and runtime extensions. This pattern is commonly used for frameworks or when you want to change or add behavior to objects without modifying their classes.
